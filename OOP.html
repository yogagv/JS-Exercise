        //OOP - Object Oriented Programming
        //whenever we are creating objects, array or function, the prototype will be attached to it.

        /* 
        
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript is a programming paradigm that allows you to structure your code 
        using objects and classes. JavaScript supports OOP through prototypes and ES6 classes.

        */

        /*      Key OOP Concepts in JavaScript
        
                Classes and Objects

                Abstraction  - (Hiding or ignoring something) Abstraction means hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary parts.

                Encapsulation - Making Properties and mehtods Private inside the Class.

                Inheritance - Making properties and methods of one class(Parent) available to another class(Child).

                Polymorphism - a Child class on methods are overwritten.    
                
                3 ways to work with OOP
                ------------------------

                1) Constructor way (new keyword), Literal way (without constructor) though without constructor, it will be created with default constructor.
                2) Class way (ES6 classes) - This is the most modern way of creating classes in JavaScript
                3) Object.create()
                
                */

        const arr = [1, 2, 3];
        console.log(typeof arr);
        console.log(arr);  //we can see prototype in output.


        //Class - Classes are blueprints for creating objects. JavaScript introduced classes in ES6.

        /* Syntax  - this is blueprint.

            class ClassName {
                constructor(parameters) {
                  // Initialize properties
            }
        methodName() {
            // Method logic
            }
        }

        then we can use the class for object
        
        */


         //Basic Function

         const Person = function(name, year){
            this.firstname = name;                           //this.firstname = name is a property.
            this.birthyear = year;                           //this.birthyear = year is a property.
        }
        const yoga = new Person('yoga', 1996);               //object is nothing but instances of class. here const yoga is a instance.
        const alex = new Person('alex', 1990);
        console.log(yoga);
        console.log(alex);

        Person.prototype.calcAge = function(){              //method
            console.log(2024 - this.birthyear);
        }

        Person.prototype.show = function() {

            console.log(`your first name is ${this.firstname}`);
        }

        yoga.calcAge();
        alex.calcAge();
    
        yoga.show();

        //with constructor, if we dont' create a class with constructor , it will be created with default constructor by javascript.

        class User {

                constructor(username, password){                 //constructor - methos
                this.username = username;                        //this.username = username is a property
                this.password = password;                        //this.password = password is a property
            }

            //when we use(arrow or normal function) log : ()=>{}, JavaScript creates a new greet function for each instance.
            //person1 and person2 do not share the same function. that's why we go with log(){}
            
            // JavaScript creates log once and stores it in User.prototype.
             //Every instance (e.g., person_1, person_2) shares the same function.
            log(){                                                                  // log is a method
                //login logic
                console.log(`your username is ${this.username} nd password is ${this.password}`);
            }
        }

        const person_1 = new User('mayuras', 'mayuras@123');    //object is nothing but instances of class. here const person_1 is a instance.
        person_1.log();  
        console.log(person_1);
        const person_2 = new User('vednesh', 'ved@123');
        person_2.log();
        const person_3 = new User('skilldev', 'skilldeo@123'); 
        person_3.log();

        console.log(person_1 === person_2);

        // 'new' keyword in javaScript automatically creates a new object.
        // inside a class constructor, 'this' refers to the new object being created., If we don't use new, this would refer to undefined
        // If new is used, JavaScript automatically returns the newly created object.


        //based on that User class we are gonna create one object
        //in, person_1,2,3 object we can see all the methods and properties of User class this is called instantiation.
        //Instantiation in JavaScript refers to the creation of a new object (an instance) from a class or constructor function. 
        //It's the process of bringing a blueprint (the class or constructor) to life, resulting in a concrete object with its own properties and methods.
                          


        //Abstraction (Hiding implementation details)

        //Only the necessary details are exposed, while internal logic remains hidden.

        // Users donâ€™t need to know how the login works; they just call log().

        // Example: The user doesnâ€™t need to know how passwords are stored or verified internally.


        //inheritance (one class(subclass) can inherit properties and methods of another class(super class))

        //Inheritance in JavaScript is implemented using the prototype chain. A subclass inherits properties and methods from its superclass through the prototype chain.

                return `Employee name is ${this.name} and age is ${this.age}`;
                
            }
        }

        const emp = new Employee('Yoga', 28);
        console.log(emp);
        emp.data();

        class EmployeeRole extends Employee {
            
            constructor(name, age, role) {

                //inherit name and age is from Employee class

                super(name, age)   //super keyword is used to inherit properties and methods from parent class
                this.role = role;
            }

        // Encapsulation(Restricting Access to Data) - It refers to hiding the internal details of an object and only exposing    necessary parts. 
        //making properties private so they are not directly accessed or modified.
        //Prevents accidental modification of sensitive data.

//Ploymorphism(Method Overriding in Child Class)

//A child class can override a method from the parent class and provide a different implementation.
